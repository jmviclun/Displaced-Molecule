This is a collection of scripts and a fortran code that takes the configuration of a molecule and displaces it from a reference atom/molecule by a straight line from their center of masses.

It saves the displaced molecule configuration in a .xyz file or in a restart file according to the format of RASPA software.

Download the code in the Home directory and enter in the downloaded folder "Displaced-Molecule".

Give executable permissions (if necessary) to the prepare.scp script and run it: 

$  chmod +x prepare.scp 

$  ./prepare.scp
